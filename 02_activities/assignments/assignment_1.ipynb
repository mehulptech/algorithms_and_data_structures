    "==> The solution works because it uses a breadth-first search (BFS) way to traverse the tree level by level, checking each node’s value for duplicates as it goes further deep inside the tree structure. As we are using BFS, it helps in finding the duplicate(s) that are closest to the root as nodes are processed level by level, from left to right within each level. We also track the seen values by keeping those in a set allowing us to compare the next value to detect duplicates. As soon as the first duplicate is found, it is returned by ensuring it is closes to the root. Also, we make sure to return -1 if no duplicates are found."
