    "A) Problems with large ranges: So, basically, if max(nums) is large, creating the full range (range(n + 1)) consumes a lot of memory and time. This can be avoided by using min(nums) and max(nums) to avoid unnecessary calculations for numbers outside the actual range of consideration.  \n",
    "B) The function assumes that the list contains valid integers only. If an invalid input (e.g., strings, floats) is given, the function will create an error. We can sdd checks in the function to ensure all elements in nums are integers and handle edge cases like negative numbers or invalid data types.  \n",
    "C) Problem with Disjoint or Non-Sequential Inputs: If nums is highly sparse (e.g., [1000, 2000, 3000]), the solution will compute the range [0, 3000], which may be unnecessary. This can be avoided by iterating over the range [0, max(nums)] and checking the missing number directly to reduce memory overhead."

    "To tackle the question-1 of finding duplicates in a binary tree of Assignment-1, I first analyzed and understood the requirements clearly: I needed to identify duplicate values and return the one closest to the root. I began by considering tree traversal methods. I found BFS (Breadth-First Search) to be well-suited because it explores nodes level by level, which naturally ensures the closest duplicates to the root are found first.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then decided to use a set to store values as I traversed the tree. This would help quickly identify duplicates since checking if an element exists in a set is efficient. During traversal, if a value was already in the set, I would return it immediately as the first duplicate. If no duplicates were found, the function would return -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this approach ensured optimal time and space complexity, both being O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For Assignment-2, I first tried to understand the challenge of missing number problem. I started reviewing my partner's code and tried to understand it as thoroughly as possible line by line. The comments made by Sehroz in his code was much helpful in understanding the logic and what's the overall thought process while building this function. There were some challenges in understanding the time and space complexities of the code written, but eventually I was able to understand and could find some limitations. The approach worked well for small inputs, it could become inefficient for larger ranges, consuming significant memory and time. The code also requires a way to handle disjoint or sparse inputs. The entire process helped me understand the problem and code from a different perspective and also to review and troubleshoot, which further gives a boost to my coding skills."
